As implied by the name, the intention is to create the simplest server!

More specifically, the intention is to create the simplest server that will display HTML pages and CSS from a stylesheet, and also, in this case, which uses a separate routes page.

HTML has in fact been placed on pages which use an EJS extension.

Feel free to copy and use!
